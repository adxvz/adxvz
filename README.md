# 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Adam... 

They say _"it's not the destination, but the journey"_ <br><br>

As such, after a decade and a half in operational support roles, I decided to take the _scenic route_ to DevOps.<br>
You can track the progress of my journey through [left brain](google.com).

Alternatively, you can join me on any of my mini detours/sidequests that I find myself on along the way.
